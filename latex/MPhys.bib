  abstract = {The homotopy theory of topological defects in ordered media fails to completely characterize systems with broken translational symmetry. We argue that the problem can be understood in terms of the lack of rotational Goldstone modes in such systems and provide an alternate approach that correctly accounts for the interaction between translations and rotations. Dislocations are associated, as usual, with branch points in a phase field, whereas disclinations arise as critical points and singularities in the phase field. We introduce a three-dimensional model for two-dimensional smectics that clarifies the topology of disclinations and geometrically captures known results without the need to add compatibility conditions. Our work suggests natural generalizations of the two-dimensional smectic theory to higher dimensions and to crystals.},

  abstract = {We propose a general formalism to characterize orientational frustration of smectic liquid crystals in confinement by interpreting the emerging networks of grain boundaries as objects with a topological charge. In a formal idealization, this charge is distributed in pointlike units of quarter-integer magnitude, which we identify with tetratic disclinations located at the end points and nodes. This coexisting nematic and tetratic order is analyzed with the help of extensive Monte Carlo simulations for a broad range of two-dimensional confining geometries as well as colloidal experiments, showing how the observed defect networks can be universally reconstructed from simple building blocks. We further find that the curvature of the confining wall determines the anchoring behavior of grain boundaries, such that the number of nodes in the emerging networks and the location of their end points can be tuned by changing the number and smoothness of corners, respectively.},

  abstract = {Matter self-assembling into layers generates unique properties, including structures of stacked surfaces, directed transport, and compact area maximization that can be highly functionalized in biology and technology. Smectics represent the paradigm of such lamellar materials — they are a state between fluids and solids, characterized by both orientational and partial positional ordering in one layering direction, making them notoriously difficult to model, particularly in confining geometries. We propose a complex tensor order parameter to describe the local degree of lamellar ordering, layer displacement and orientation of the layers for simple, lamellar smectics. The theory accounts for both dislocations and disclinations, by regularizing singularities within defect cores and so remaining continuous everywhere. The ability to describe disclinations and dislocation allows this theory to simulate arrested configurations and inclusion-induced local ordering. This tensorial theory for simple smectics considerably simplifies numerics, facilitating studies on the mesoscopic structure of topologically complex systems.},

  abstract = {Confined samples of liquid crystals are characterized by a variety of topological defects and can be exposed to external constraints such as extreme confinements with nontrivial topology. Here we explore the intrinsic structure of smectic colloidal layers dictated by the interplay between entropy and an imposed external topology. Considering an annular confinement as a basic example, a plethora of competing states is found with nontrivial defect structures ranging from laminar states to multiple smectic domains and arrays of edge dislocations, which we refer to as Shubnikov states in formal analogy to the characteristic of type-II superconductors. Our particle-resolved results, gained by a combination of real-space microscopy of thermal colloidal rods and fundamental-measure-based density functional theory of hard anisotropic bodies, agree on a quantitative level.},
