  abstract = {The theory of phase ordering kinetics is reviewed, and new results for systems with continuous symmetry presented. A generalisation of “Porod's law” for the tail of the structure factor, of the form S(k, t) ∼ k−(d+n)L(t)−n for kL(t) ≫ 1, where L(t) is the characteristic length scale at time t after the quench, is derived where, for a vector order parameter, n is simply the number of components of the vector. The power-law tail is shown to be associated with topological defects in the field, and its amplitude is calculated exactly in terms of the defect density. For a conserved vector order parameter the multiscaling form obtained for n = ∞ is argued to be special to this limit. Using an approximate theory due to Mazenko, it is shown that conventional scaling is recovered, for any finite n, when t→∞, with L(t)∼ (tln n)14 for n large.},

  abstract = {The homotopy theory of topological defects in ordered media fails to completely characterize systems with broken translational symmetry. We argue that the problem can be understood in terms of the lack of rotational Goldstone modes in such systems and provide an alternate approach that correctly accounts for the interaction between translations and rotations. Dislocations are associated, as usual, with branch points in a phase field, whereas disclinations arise as critical points and singularities in the phase field. We introduce a three-dimensional model for two-dimensional smectics that clarifies the topology of disclinations and geometrically captures known results without the need to add compatibility conditions. Our work suggests natural generalizations of the two-dimensional smectic theory to higher dimensions and to crystals.},

This analogy leads to the following predictions for a second order smectic A↔ nematic transition: (1) the transition temperature is lowered if twist, or bend distortions are imposed: these distortions correspond to a magnetic field in superconductors. (2) the Frank coefficients K2 and K3 of the nematic phase must show pretransitional anomalies.

Cette analogie conduit aux prédictions suivantes, pour le voisinage d'une transition smectique A ↔ nématique du 2eme ordre: (1) la température de transition biasse si une distorsion de torsion ou de flexion est imposée: ces distortions sont l'analogue d'un champ magnétique pour un supraconducteur.

These properties may emerge from the collective behaviour of simple fundamental constituents, and are studied using statistical field theories. Initial chapters connect the particulate perspective developed in the companion volume, to the coarse grained statistical fields studied here. Based on lectures taught by Professor Kardar at MIT, this textbook demonstrates how such theories are formulated and studied. Perturbation theory, exact solutions, renormalization groups, and other tools are employed to demonstrate the emergence of scale invariance and universality, and the non-equilibrium dynamics of interfaces and directed paths in random media are discussed.

  abstract = {Curvature is an important concept for understanding layering structures in soft matters, ranging from complex macromolecular self-assembled structures to simple lipid bilayers. Among the various kinds of soft matters, smectic liquid crystal (LC) phases have been widely studied because of their periodic featured curvatures under various external forces. Generally, their curvatures are on the micron-scale due to the bulk elasticity of smectic LC materials. In this review, a combination of sublimation and recondensation of smectic LC materials generates a variety of curvatures at the nanometer scale, which cannot be achieved by self-assembly under thermal equilibrium conditions. In particular, we have focused on the change of curvatures in focal conic domains under non-equilibrium conditions, in which negative and zero Gaussian curvatures in the micron-scale transform to positive Gaussian curvatures in the micron- and nanometer scales. Finally, the review closes with applications using such non-equilibrium self-assembly of smectics.},

Since then, chiral smectic phases and their plethora of polar effects have dominated the research in this field, which today has reached a mature state where the first commercial microdisplay applications are now shipping in millions-per-year quantities. In this Review we discuss some of the topics of highest interest in current smectic liquid crystal research, and address application-relevant research (de Vries-type tilting transitions without defect generation and high-tilt antiferroelectric liquid crystals with perfect dark state) as well as more curiosity-driven research (the nature and origin of the chiral smectic C subphases and their intermediate frustrated states between ferro- and antiferroelectricity).},

  abstract = {Using angular momentum representation a method is proposed that allows the systematic construction of a generalized Landau-de Gennes elastic free energy of liquid crystals, in powers of a symmetric and traceless tensor order parameter, polarization field, of external fields and all respective derivatives. By this method all linearly independent elastic invariants and surface terms are constructed for nematics and cholesterics up to fourth order terms. In particular it is shown that up to fourth order in the tensor order parameter there are nineteen bulk elastic constants and four surface terms in the free energy of a general, biaxial nematic. In addition, the stability of this expansion is studied in detail. Some special cases of the elastic free energy of liquid crystals, already discussed in the literature, are reexamined and discrepancies with our results are emphasized. Finally, a thermo-dynamically correct way of establishing contact between the generalized de Gennes elastic free energy and other theories, like those of Oseen-Frank or Meyer, is proposed by applying fluctuation theory. Thus, the degeneracy of splay and bend elastic constants is removed even when these are calculated from the standard de Gennes free energy. Restrictions on higher order elastic constants are also obtained by comparing mean field relations and stability conditions with available experimental data.},

  abstract = {Liquid crystals are considered as gases of long barlike molecules. Variables describing the position and orientation of individual molecules are introduced. These are used to arrive at a microscopic definition of the order in liquid crystals in terms of a symmetric traceless tensor. The Frank and Leslie-Ericksen directors are shown to be equivalent to the unit eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of this symmetric traceless tensor. Attention is then restricted to nematics. It is shown that the Frank free energy gives a valid description of equilibrium properties of nematics to order χaH2ρκTm−1, where χa is the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility, H the external magnetic field, ρ the mass density, T the temperature, k the Boltzmann constant, and m the molecular mass. Microscopic justification is given for the linearized Leslie-Ericksen hydrodynamic theory for nematics. A microscopic response-function description of nematics is then presented, and contact is made between the general frequency- and wave-number-dependent response functions and those calculated from the phenomenological hydrodynamic theory. Applications to light scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance are considered. 1T1 calculated here differs from that calculated from the Pincus theory by a factor of S2, where S is the parameter measuring the degree of nematic order.},

In a formal idealization, this charge is distributed in pointlike units of quarter-integer magnitude, which we identify with tetratic disclinations located at the end points and nodes. This coexisting nematic and tetratic order is analyzed with the help of extensive Monte Carlo simulations for a broad range of two-dimensional confining geometries as well as colloidal experiments, showing how the observed defect networks can be universally reconstructed from simple building blocks. We further find that the curvature of the confining wall determines the anchoring behavior of grain boundaries, such that the number of nodes in the emerging networks and the location of their end points can be tuned by changing the number and smoothness of corners, respectively.},

Smectics represent the paradigm of such lamellar materials — they are a state between fluids and solids, characterized by both orientational and partial positional ordering in one layering direction, making them notoriously difficult to model, particularly in confining geometries. We propose a complex tensor order parameter to describe the local degree of lamellar ordering, layer displacement and orientation of the layers for simple, lamellar smectics. The theory accounts for both dislocations and disclinations, by regularizing singularities within defect cores and so remaining continuous everywhere. The ability to describe disclinations and dislocation allows this theory to simulate arrested configurations and inclusion-induced local ordering. This tensorial theory for simple smectics considerably simplifies numerics, facilitating studies on the mesoscopic structure of topologically complex systems.},

  abstract = {An electroconvective pattern called soft-mode turbulence (SMT) of homeotropic alignment in MBBA (4’-Methoxy-benzylidene-4-butyl-aniline) nematic liquid crystal appears when an external electric field with a certain frequency applied on the nematic liquid crystal sample at a threshold voltage ( V SMT ). The threshold voltage will increase with increasing of frequency. SMT fluctuation occurs when V SMT continues to increase at the same frequency. This phenomenon can be analized by applying an image processing tecnique. Based on image feature extraction method, inhomogeneity of SMT patterns can be observed through contrast, correlation, energy, homogeneity, and entropy parameters. Those parameters represent a result in accordance with the image visualization. Significant changes in the value of contrast, energy, homogeneity, and entropy parameters occur at V {$>$} V SMT which fluctuation begin. In this experiment the fluctuation begin at V = 27.3 V.}

  abstract = {Confined samples of liquid crystals are characterized by a variety of topological defects and can be exposed to external constraints such as extreme confinements with nontrivial topology. Here we explore the intrinsic structure of smectic colloidal layers dictated by the interplay between entropy and an imposed external topology. Considering an annular confinement as a basic example, a plethora of competing states is found with nontrivial defect structures ranging from laminar states to multiple smectic domains and arrays of edge dislocations, which we refer to as Shubnikov states in formal analogy to the characteristic of type-II superconductors. Our particle-resolved results, gained by a combination of real-space microscopy of thermal colloidal rods and fundamental-measure-based density functional theory of hard anisotropic bodies, agree on a quantitative level.},
